description: Google Cloud DNS is a scalable, reliable and managed authoritative Domain
  Name System (DNS) service running on the same infrastructure as Google. It has low
  latency, high availability and is a cost-effective way to make your applications
  and services available to your users. Cloud DNS translates requests for domain names
  like www.google.com into IP addresses like 74.125.29.101. Cloud DNS is programmable.
  You can easily publish and manage millions of DNS zones and records using our simple
  user interface, command-line interface or API.
